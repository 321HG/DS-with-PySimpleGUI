# DS-with-PySimpleGUI
Data science GUI programs with awesome `PySimpleGUI` package.

## Requirements

Install `PySimpleGUI` by,
```
pip install pysimplegui
```

You will also need,

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

etc. to run the demo codes.

## Demo (how to run)

There are both Jupyter notebooks and .PY scripts. The simplest way to run a GUI is to execute the .PY scripts, e.g.
```
python SimpleDataFrame.py
```

This will show a file browser dialog first, followed by other prompts.

If you want to experiment with the code, you can look at the Notebooks and play with them.
