# DS-with-PySimpleGUI
Data science GUI programs with awesome `PySimpleGUI` package.

## Requirements

Install `PySimpleGUI` by,
```
pip install pysimplegui
```

You will also need,

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

etc. to run the demo codes.

## Demo (how to run)

There are both Jupyter notebooks and .PY scripts. The simplest way to run a GUI is to execute the .PY scripts, e.g.
```
python SimpleDataFrame.py
```
### File browser
This will show a file browser dialog first,

### Descriptive stats
After you close that window, a new popup will ask if you want to see the descriptive statistics about this dataset. If you click 'Yes', then you will see something like this,
